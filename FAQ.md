# ❓ SolShield FAQ

Frequently asked questions about SolShield.

---

## General

### What is SolShield?
An AI-powered smart contract auditor for Solana that detects 580+ vulnerability patterns in seconds.

### How is it different from manual audits?
| Aspect | Manual Audit | SolShield |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Time | 1-4 weeks | < 1 second |
| Cost | $10K-$100K | Free (beta) |
| Coverage | Varies | 580+ patterns |
| Consistency | Human-dependent | Deterministic |

### Is it free?
Yes, currently in free beta. Future pricing TBD.

### Can I trust it for production?
SolShield is a first line of defense. For high-value protocols (>$10M TVL), we recommend combining SolShield with professional audits. SolShield catches the easy stuff so auditors can focus on complex logic.

## Technical

### What patterns does it detect?
580+ patterns covering:
- Core Security (ownership, signers, initialization)
- CPI Security (arbitrary CPI, reentrancy)
- Arithmetic (overflow, rounding, precision)
- PDA Security (validation, bumps, collision)
- Token Security (mint authority, freeze)
- DeFi Patterns (oracle manipulation, flash loans)
- NFT Patterns (Metaplex security)
- And more...

See full list: `SolShield list`

### Does it support native Solana (non-Anchor)?
Currently optimized for Anchor programs. Native Solana support is on the roadmap.

### What output formats are supported?
- Terminal (colored, human-readable)
- JSON (programmatic access)
- Markdown (documentation)
- SARIF (GitHub Code Scanning)

### How does the on-chain registry work?
Audit results are stored as PDAs on Solana:
```
seeds = [b"audit", program_id]
```
Other programs can verify audit status via CPI before interacting with unaudited code.

## Usage

### How do I audit my program?
```bash
# Install
# From source (npm package coming soon)
git clone https://github.com/oh-ashen-one/SolShield.git
cd SolShield/packages/cli && npm install && npm run build && npm link

# Audit
SolShield audit ./path/to/program
```

### Can I audit from GitHub?
Yes!
```bash
SolShield github owner/repo
SolShield github owner/repo --pr 123
```

### Can I audit on-chain programs?
Yes, by program ID:
```bash
SolShield fetch <PROGRAM_ID> --rpc https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

### How do I integrate with CI/CD?
See [INTEGRATIONS.md](INTEGRATIONS.md) for GitHub Actions templates.

### What if I get a false positive?
Open an issue on GitHub with:
1. The code that triggered the false positive
2. Why you believe it's safe
3. Which pattern flagged it

We continuously improve pattern accuracy.

## Hackathon

### Was this really built by an AI agent?
Yes, 100%. Every line of code was written by Midir (an AI agent on Clawdbot). See [HACKATHON.md](HACKATHON.md) for the full story.

### Why 580+ patterns?
Agents don't get tired. We researched every known Solana vulnerability class, audit reports, and post-mortems, then implemented detection for each.

### Is the on-chain program deployed?
Code is complete in `packages/program/`. Deployment to devnet is in progress. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Security

### Is my code sent anywhere?
- **CLI:** Code is parsed locally, never transmitted
- **Web UI:** Code is sent to the API for processing, not stored
- **GitHub audit:** Fetches from public GitHub, processed server-side

### Can SolShield have vulnerabilities?
Yes, it's software. Report security issues per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Does SolShield guarantee my code is safe?
No. SolShield catches known vulnerability patterns. Novel attacks, business logic errors, and complex interactions may not be detected. Always conduct thorough testing.

## Contributing

### How can I contribute?
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome:
- New vulnerability patterns
- False positive reports
- Documentation improvements
- Feature requests

### Can I add my own patterns?
Yes! Patterns are modular TypeScript files. See `packages/cli/src/patterns/` for examples.
