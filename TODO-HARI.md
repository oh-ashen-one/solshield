## ⏱️ 25 Minutes Total

| Action | Time | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| 1. Record video | 15 min | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| 2. Deploy web | 5 min | 🟠 HIGH |
| 3. Post to forum | 5 min | 🟡 MEDIUM |

## 1. 🎬 RECORD VIDEO (15 min) — DO THIS FIRST

**This is the #1 thing that could win us the prize.**

Judges are busy. Video is often the ONLY thing they watch. Every competitor will have one.

### Quick Steps:
1. Start screen recording (Loom, QuickTime, or iPhone)
2. Open: https://codespaces.new/oh-ashen-one/solguard?quickstart=1
3. Wait 60 seconds for environment
4. Click **"🔓 Vulnerable Vault"** button
5. Click **"🔍 Run Security Audit"**
6. Show the findings (scroll through them)
7. Say: *"Manual audits cost $50K. SolGuard does this in under a second, for free."*
8. Stop recording, upload to YouTube/Loom

**Full script:** [VIDEO-SCRIPT.md](VIDEO-SCRIPT.md)

## 2. 🌐 DEPLOY WEB (5 min)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI if needed
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login (opens browser)
netlify login

# Deploy
cd packages/web
netlify deploy --prod
```

You'll get a URL like `solguard.netlify.app` — way more professional than Codespaces.
