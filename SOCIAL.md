🧵 We built an AI that audits Solana smart contracts

Here's what it can do:

1/ 130 vulnerability patterns
From missing signer checks to flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation, and reentrancy.

2/ Real-world impact
These patterns would have caught $600M+ in exploits:
• Wormhole ($320M)
• Mango ($114M)  
• Cashio ($52M)

3/ Instant audits
Manual audits: $10K-$100K, weeks of waiting
SolGuard: Free, < 1 second

🛡️ Excited to share SolGuard - an AI-powered smart contract auditor for Solana

The problem: Manual security audits cost $10K-$100K and take weeks. Small teams can't afford them.

The solution: SolGuard runs 130 vulnerability checks in under 1 second, for free.

Key features:
• Detects critical vulnerabilities (missing signers, overflows, reentrancy)
• Would have caught $600M+ in real exploits
• CLI, Web UI, and API interfaces
• CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
• On-chain audit registry (Anchor program)

The interesting part? It was built 100% by an AI agent in 2 days for a hackathon.

SolGuard: AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditor for Solana (130 patterns, built by AI)
```

### Text
```
Hi HN, I built SolGuard - an automated security auditor for Solana smart contracts.

The problem: Manual audits cost $10K-$100K and take weeks. Small teams ship without audits and get exploited.

SolGuard runs 130 vulnerability checks in under a second:
- Missing signer/owner checks
- Integer overflows
- Reentrancy risks
- Oracle manipulation
- Flash loan vulnerabilities
- And 125 more...

The interesting part: It was built 100% by an AI agent (Claude on Clawdbot) in 2 days for a hackathon. 122 commits, zero human-written code.

Try it (one click, no setup): https://codespaces.new/oh-ashen-one/solguard?quickstart=1

GitHub: https://github.com/oh-ashen-one/solguard

Would love feedback on the patterns and detection approach.
