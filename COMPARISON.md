## Unique to SolShield

### 1. On-Chain Audit Registry
```rust
// Other programs can verify audits via CPI
let passed = SolShield::cpi::verify_audit(ctx)?;
require!(passed, ErrorCode::NotAudited);
```

No other tool stores audit results on-chain for composable verification.

### 2. 580+ patterns (Largest Coverage)
- Core Security (SOL001-SOL015)
- CPI Security (SOL040-SOL055)
- DeFi Patterns (SOL056-SOL075)
- Token Security (SOL076-SOL090)
- NFT Patterns (SOL091-SOL100)
- Advanced (SOL101-SOL130)

### 3. Watch Mode for Development
```bash
SolShield watch ./program
# Re-audits on every file change
# Real-time security feedback while coding
```

### 4. GitHub Integration
```bash
# Audit any public repo
SolShield github coral-xyz/anchor

# Audit a specific PR
SolShield github solana-labs/solana --pr 1234

# Fetch and audit on-chain programs
SolShield fetch <PROGRAM_ID>
```

### 5. Built by AI, for AI Era
SolShield was 100% coded by an AI agent, demonstrating what's possible when agents build security tools. The patterns are comprehensive because an AI can process vast amounts of vulnerability research without fatigue.

## When to Use What

| Scenario | Best Choice |
|----------|-------------|
| Quick check during development | **SolShield** |
| CI/CD security gate | **SolShield** |
| Pre-deployment audit | **SolShield** + Manual |
| High-value protocol (>$10M TVL) | **SolShield** + Professional audit |
| Learning about vulnerabilities | **SolShield** (free, educational) |

## Limitations

**SolShield is NOT a replacement for professional audits when:**
- Protocol handles significant value (>$10M)
- Novel mechanisms that may have unknown attack vectors
- Regulatory or compliance requirements
- Insurance/liability considerations

**SolShield excels at:**
- Catching common vulnerabilities early
- Continuous security during development
- Educational feedback for developers
- First line of defense before professional review

## Cost Analysis

### Without SolShield (Traditional)
```
Development: 2 months
Wait for audit slot: 1-2 months
Audit: $50,000
Fixes + re-audit: $10,000
Total: 3-4 months, $60,000
```

### With SolShield (Hybrid)
```
Development + continuous SolShield: 2 months
Pre-audit fixes from SolShield: $0
Professional audit (cleaner code): $30,000
Fewer issues = faster audit
Total: 2-3 months, $30,000
```

**Savings: 50% cost, 25% time**

## Summary

SolShield isn't trying to replace professional auditors — it's trying to make security accessible to everyone, catch issues early, and ensure even small teams can ship secure code.

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **SolShield** | Speed, cost, coverage, CI/CD, development |
| **Soteria** | Specific deep checks |
| **Sec3** | Enterprise workflows |
| **Manual Audit** | High-stakes deployments |

*The best security strategy uses multiple tools. SolShield is the fast, free first line.*
